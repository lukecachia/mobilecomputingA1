                    Road ID is a company which sells safety braclets which contain information
                    about the person in case of an emeregency.
                    <br><br>
                    This company also has an app which
                    displays the personal details on the lock screen of a smartphone. Further to this,
                    the app has the functionality of tracking the location and calls emergency services or relatives in case
                    the phone is stationery for a long time. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, the problem with such app is that this approach has a single point of failure.
                    If the user runs out of battery or forgets to wear the braclet the whole purpose is defeated.
